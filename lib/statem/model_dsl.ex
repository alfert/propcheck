defmodule PropCheck.StateM.ModelDSL do
  @moduledoc """
  This module provides a shallow DSL (domain specific language) in Elixir for
  property based testing of stateful systems. It's built upon `PropCheck.StateM`
  and all it's the characteristics apply here as well. It's a replacement for
  `PropCheck.StateM.DSL`.

  ## The basic approach

  Property based testing of stateful systems is different from ordinary property
  based testing. Instead of testing operations and their effects on the data
  structure directly, we construct a model of the system and generate a sequence
  of commands operating on both, the model and the system. Then we check that
  after each command step, the system has evolved accordingly to the model.
  This is the same idea which is used in model checking and is sometimes called
  a bisimulation.

  After defining a model, we have two phases during executing the property.  In
  phase 1, the generators create a list of (symbolic) commands including their
  parameters to be run against the system under test (SUT). A state machine
  guides the generation of commands.

  In phase 2, the commands are executed and the state machine checks that  the
  SUT is in the same state as the state machine. If an invalid state is
  detected, then the command sequence is shrunk towards a shorter sequence
  serving then as counterexamples.

  This approach works exactly the same as with `PropCheck.StateM` and
  `PropCheck.FSM`. The main difference is the API, grouping pre- and
  postconditions, state transitions around the commands of the SUT. This leads
  towards more logical locality compared to the former implementations.
  QuickCheck EQC has a similar approach for structuring their modern state
  machines.

  ## The DSL

  A state machine acting as a model of the SUT can be defined by focusing on
  states or on transitions. We focus here on the transitions. A transition is a
  command calling the SUT. Therefore the main phrase of the DSL is the
  `defcommand` macro.

      defcommand :find do
        # define the rules for executing the find command here
      end

  Inside the `defcommand` macro, we define all the rules which the command must
  obey. As an example, we discuss here as an example the slightly simplified
  command `:find` from `test/cache_dsl_test.exs`. The SUT is a cache
  implementation based on an ETS and the model is is based on a list of
  (key/value)-pairs. This example is derived from [Fred Hebert's PropEr Testing,
  Chapter 9](http://propertesting.com/book_stateful_properties.html)

  The `find`-command is a call to the `find/1` API function. Its arguments are
  generated in `c:command_gen/1` (described later) callback, which for this
  command is using just one argument, a `key()` generator. Next, we need to
  define the execution of the command by defining function `impl/n`.  The
  `impl`-function allows to apply conversion of parameters and return values to
  ease the testing. A typical example is the conversion of an `{:ok, value}`
  tuple to only `value` which can simplify working with `value`.

      defcommand :find do
        def impl(key), do: Cache.find(key)
      end

  After defining how a command is executed, we need to define in which state
  this is allowed. For this, we define function `pre/2`, taking the model state
  and the generated list of arguments to check whether this call is allowed in
  the current model state. In this particular example, `find` is always allowed,
  hence we return `true` without any further checking. This is also the default
  implementation and the reason why the precondition is missing in the test
  file.

      defcommand :find do
        def impl(key), do: Cache.find(key)
        def pre(_state, [_key]), do: true
      end

  If the precondition is satisfied, the call can happen. After the call, the SUT
  can be in a different state and the model state must be updated according to
  the mapping of the SUT to the model. The function `next/3` takes the state
  before the call, the list of arguments and the symbolic or dynamic result
  (depending on phase 1 or 2, respectively). `next/3` returns the new model
  state. Since searching for a key in the cache does not modify the system nor
  the model state, nothing has to be done. This is again the default
  implementation and thus left out in the test file.

      defcommand :find do
        def impl(key), do: Cache.find(key)
        def pre(_state, [_key]), do: true
        def next(old_state, _args, call_result), do: old_state
      end

  The missing part of the command definition is the post condition, checking
  that after calling the system in phase 2, the system is in the expected state
  compared the model. This check is implemented in function `post/3`, which
  again has a trivial default implementation for post conditions that always
  returns true. In this example, we check if we can find the key in our list of
  `entries` and if we do, we check if `call_result` resulted in `{:ok, val}`. Or
  if we don't found it, we check if the SUT also cannot find it by comparing if
  `call_result` returned `{:error, :not_found}`.

      defcommand :find do
        def impl(key), do: Cache.find(key)
        def pre(_state, [_key]), do: true
        def next(old_state, _args, _call_result), do: old_state
        def post(entries, [key], call_result) do
          case List.keyfind(entries, key, 0, false) do
              false       -> call_result == {:error, :not_found}
              {^key, val} -> call_result == {:ok, val}
          end
        end
      end

  This completes the DSL for command definitions.

  ## Additional model elements

  In addition to commands, we need to define the model itself. This is the
  ingenious part of stateful property based testing! The initial state of the
  model must be implemented as the function `initial_state/0`. It doesn't accept
  any arguments, because this function has to be deterministic. From this
  function, all model evolutions start. In our simplified cache example the
  initial model is an empty list:

      def initial_state(), do: []

  The sequence of commands to be run is generated repeatedly by
  `c:command_gen/1` callback. The generator has to return a tuple of with a
  command name and a list of it's arguments (a list of generators). This
  callback expects the current state as an argument, which often is used to
  determine the next one from a set of appropriate commands (e.g. there might
  not be much sense in calling the `delete_user` command, if there are no users
  in the system yet). Usually a `PropCheck.BasicTypes.oneof/1` or
  `PropCheck.BasicTypes.frequency/1` generators are used to pick one of possible
  commands. In our cache example we want the `find` command to appear three
  times more often than other commands:

      def command_gen(_state) do
        frequency([
          {3, {:find, [key()]}},
          {1, {:cache, [key(), val()]}},
          {1, {:flush, []}}
        ])

  ## The property to test

  The property to test the stateful system is more or less the same for all systems.
  We generate all commands via generator `commands/1`, which takes
  a module with callbacks as parameter. Inside the test, we first start
  the SUT, execute the commands with `run_commands/1`, stopping the SUT
  and evaluating the result of the executions as a boolean expression.
  This boolean expression can be adorned with further functions and macros
  to analyze the generated commands (via `PropCheck.aggregate/2`) or to
  inspect the history if a failure occurs (via `PropCheck.when_fail/2`).
  In the test cases, you find more examples of such adornments.

      property "run the sequential cache", [:verbose] do
        forall cmds <- commands(__MODULE__) do
          Cache.start_link(@cache_size)
          {_history, _state, result} = run_commands(cmds)
          Cache.stop()
          (result == :ok)
        end
      end

  ## Increasing the Number of Commands in a Sequence

  Sometimes issues can hide when the command sequences are short. In order to
  tease out these hidden bugs we can increase the number of commands generated
  by using the `max_size` option in our property.

        property "run the sequential cache", [max_size: 250] do
        forall cmds <- commands(__MODULE__) do
          Cache.start_link(@cache_size)
          {_history, _state, result} = run_commands(cmds)
          Cache.stop()
          (result == :ok)
        end
