defmodule PropCheck.FSM do
  @moduledoc """
  The finite state machine approach for stateful systems, which is closer
  to Erlang's `gen_fsm` model.

  This module defines the `proper_fsm` behaviour, useful for testing
  systems that can be modeled as finite state machines. That is, a finite
  collection of named states and transitions between them. `PropCheck.FSM` is
  closely related to `PropCheck.StateM` and is, in fact, implemented in
  terms of that. Test cases generated using `PropCheck.FSM` will be on precisely
  the same form as test cases generated using `PropCheck.StateM`. The
  difference lies in the way the callback modules are specified.
  The relation between `PropCheck.StateM` and `PropCheck.FSM` is similar
  to the one between `gen_server` and `gen_fsm` in OTP libraries.

  Due to name conflicts with functions automatically imported from
  `PropCheck.StateM`, a fully qualified call is needed in order to
  use the  <a href="#functions">API functions </a> of `PropCheck.FSM`.

  ## The states of the finite state machine

  Following the convention used in `gen_fsm behaviour`, the state is
  separated into types `t:state_name/0` and some
  `t:state_data/0`. `state_name` is used to denote a state
  of the finite state machine and `state_data` is any relevant information
  that has to be stored in the model state. States are fully
  represented as tuples `{state_name, state_data}`.

  `state_name` is usually an atom (i.e. the name of the state), but can also
  be a tuple. In the latter case, the first element of the tuple must be an
  atom specifying the name of the state, whereas the rest of the elements can
  be arbitrary terms specifying state attributes. For example, when
  implementing the fsm of an elevator which can reach n different floors, the
  `state_name` for each floor could be `{:floor, k}, 1 <= k <= n`.

  `state_data` can be an arbitrary term, but is usually a record.

  ## Transitions between states

  A transition `t:transition/0` is represented as a tuple
  `{target_state, {:call, m, f, a}}`. This means that performing the specified
  symbolic call at the current state of the fsm will lead to `target_state`.
  The atom `:history` can be used as `target_state` to denote that a transition
  does not change the current state of the fsm.

  ## The callback functions

  The following functions must be exported from the callback module
  implementing the finite state machine:

  * `c:initial_state/0`
  * `c:initial_data/0`
  * `c:precondition/4`
  * `c:postcondition/5`
  * `c:next_state_data/5`
  * `c:weight/3`

  In addition to these functions, we also need functions for each
  state:

  * `state_name(s::state_data) ::[transition]`
    <br>There should be one instance of this function for each reachable
    state `state_name` of the finite state machine. In case `state_name` is a
    tuple the function takes a different form, described just below. The
    function returns a list of possible transitions (`t:transition/0` )
    from the current state.

    At command generation time, the instance of this function with the same
    name as the current state's name is called to return the list of possible
    transitions. Then, PropEr will randomly choose a transition and,
    according to that, generate the next symbolic call to be included in the
    command sequence. However, before the call is actually included, a
    precondition that might impose constraints on `state_data` is checked.

    Note also that PropEr detects transitions that would raise an exception
    of class `<error>` at generation time (not earlier) and does not choose
    them. This feature can be used to include conditional transitions that
    depend on the `t:state_data/0`.
  * `state_name(attr1::any, ..., attrN::any,
                  s::type state_data) :: [transition]`
    <br>There should be one instance of this function for each reachable state
    `{state_name, attr1, ..., attrN}` of the finite state machine. The function
    has similar behaviour to `state_name/1`, described above.

  ## The property used

  This is an example of a property that can be used to test a
  finite state machine specification. It expects a `cleanup` function
  that takes care of removing all artifacts created during tests to
  enable a clean start for each test case execution.

      property "fsm" do
         forall cmds <- commands(__MODULE__) do
           {_history, _state, result} = run_commands(__MODULE__, cmds)
           cleanup()
           result == :ok
        end
      end
